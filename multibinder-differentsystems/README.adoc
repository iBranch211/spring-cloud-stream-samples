== Spring Cloud Stream Multibinder Application with Different Systems

This example shows how to run a Spring Cloud Stream application with the same binder type configured for two separate Kafka clusters.

To run the example, command line parameters for the Zookeeper ensembles and Kafka clusters must be provided, as in the following example:

````
java -jar spring-cloud-stream-samples/multibinder-differentsystems/target/spring-cloud-stream-sample-multibinder-differentsystems-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar --kafkaBroker1=localhost:9092 --zk1=localhost:2181 --kafkaBroker2=localhost:9093 --zk2=localhost:2182
````

This assumes that two Kafka clusters and Zookeeper ensembles are running locally. Alternatively, the default values of `localhost:9092` and `localhost:2181` can be provided for both clusters.
